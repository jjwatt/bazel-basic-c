# WIP
# Basic Bazel C Starter repo
Keep the main branch at "modern" best practices (as best we can tell from an outsider's perspective).

There are actually mutliple ways to do this.

1. Compile with a C++ toolchain & C externs or whatever
2. Compile with a real C toolchain

The main goal of this repo is to show how to do this with a real C toolchain, but I may offer alternative examples in the main branch or a different branch.
